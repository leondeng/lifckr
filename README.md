#Instructions:

Design and implement a solution to the following task, with the following requirements 

in mind: 

● Your solution should be clear, efficient and maintainable.

● You should demonstrate object oriented programming skills. For example: you 

should be able to manage dependencies well and ensure separation of 

responsibilities.

● Your solution must not use any external libraries or frameworks (eg. jquery, 

bootstrap, smarty, cakePHP, Symfony, composer packages etc.). The only 

exceptions from this rule are unit testing frameworks (ie. PHPUnit/Mocha) or 

packages which assist with up-time in Node.JS.

● You are free to use whatever resources or references that are available to you, 

but it is expected that the design/solution will be 100% your own.

● You should take no more than 24 hours to complete your work.

● You should submit the test in a compressed folder, with your code there should 

be a README.md for any pieces of information required to run the test.

#Task:

Create a Flickr image gallery using Node.JS or PHP. The user should be able to enter a 

keyword, which is then used to search Flickr. The search results should be paginated and 

displayed as five results per page, and the user should be able to navigate to other 

pages. Each image should be displayed as a thumbnail; clicking on the thumbnail should 

display the full-size image and any abstract or title. Keep in mind that your solution 

should work efficiently, no matter how many images match the keyword.
